This code was written using the "PlatformIO" plug-in on Visual Studio. The code was written to run on a "NodeMCU 12E". The APIs are used to control a TV and a soundbar via an IR LED.
For the whole control I developed an app that will allow the management of the device.
Import: Do not forget to change the values to be transmitted to the IR LED.
